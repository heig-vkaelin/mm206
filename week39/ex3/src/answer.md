# Task 1

## b)

When you import a module, the code is loaded asynchroniously. This means that the code is not executed immediately, but rather when the module is needed. This is why the code in the module is not executed when the module is imported. The code is executed when the module is used.

When you include directly a JavaScript file, it is done synchroniously. This means that the code is executed immediately when the file is included.

You can also use the type module in the script tag to import a module. This is the same as importing a module.
